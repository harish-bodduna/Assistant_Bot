Functional Overview

Steps to Restore Email/File in Barracuda Backup

1.  Navigate to the Desired Service:

In Barracuda Backup, click on the Protect tab at the top. From the drop-down menu, select the Microsoft service you want to restore data from. For this guide, we are restoring an email deleted on June 3, 2024, but the same process applies to other services.
